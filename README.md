### Sprint 1 Contribution 

#### Simran Narwal
 - Created the file options for Help and Exit
 - Implemented ActionListener so events would be able to perform an action
 - For Help and FAQs, I created a window displaying How to Play and FAQs
 - For Exit, I created a confirm dialog to confirm if the user wants to exit from the program

#### Koji Yoshiyama
 - Created GUI for Tetris Display including the gameboard, next piece region, and a scoreboard region. 
 - Also made extensive checkstyle edits across GameBoardGUI MenuGUI CreateGUI and AboutUs Classes.

#### Minh Vu

#### Jack Chen
 - Created GUI window for Tetris Display
### Sprint 1 Comments 
- Koji and Jack both created different Tetris Display GUIs so we decided it would be a good idea to add an option in the menu bar to be able to switch between the two, giving the user the ability to switch themes.
- Simran had issues commiting and pushing in her code. Simran was only able to commit and push in three of her classes, but the MenuGUI class would not commit and push to include her changes.
