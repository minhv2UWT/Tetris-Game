### Sprint 1 Comments 
- Koji and Jack both created different Tetris Display GUIs so we decided it would be a good idea to add an option in the menu bar to be able to switch between the two, giving the user the ability to switch themes.
- Simran had issues commiting and pushing in her code. Simran was only able to commit and push in three of her classes, but the MenuGUI class would not commit and push to include her changes. 
- Minh was trying to implement the options menu which will change the layout of the whole GUI. Having troubles working with GitHub.
- The arts are made by Minh and not downloaded from internet.
